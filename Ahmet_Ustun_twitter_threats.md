Required precautions must be taken in the jails to kill all FETO related inmates when there is a new coup attempt.

Firstly; those jails that hosts FETO’ists should not have non-FETO related inmates. The special execution teams must be ready in such jails.

Those FETO’ists that planned to be liberated from the jail, only their dead bodies can be ex-filtrated. FETO and their people in jail must [be convinced to] know this.

[Regular] Prison guards should be unarmed. The FETO’ists whose profession is soldier, police, persecutor or judge should be concentrated in 1 or 2 prisons. POH (police special forces) should be assigned [instead of regular prison guards] with permission to execute anytime.

The government must handle the FETO’ists in jail in a special manner. It is not a difficult job. Concentrate them in 1 or prisons. Assign POH (police special forces). That’s it.

The FETO’ists must [be convinced to] know that they would be killed all, in case of a new coup attempt. That would ruin their plans also cause desertions among them.
